**Update March 2017:** [It's back on the Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/do-it/cnhehlcgdklpoaleccenbnkfimbhdojf) The previous publisher violated the terms of service and got the extension pulled, tsk tsk. So there it is again, the good ol' original version.

**Update June 2016:** The [published extension on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/do-it/goijbmcncgcdpdljjnoggmdaikodcclk) has been transferred to a new owner.

A Chrome extension to have Shia as your motivational coach.

Shia appears from your dreams to remind you not to let your dreams be dreams.  
And just as quickly as he appears, he disappears.
Gone forever.  
Until you click his face again.

> **_Just do it_**

> _Don't let your dreams be dreams  
Yesterday you said tomorrow  
So just do it  
Make your dreams come true  
Just do it_

> _Some people dream of success  
While you're gonna wake up and work hard at it  
Nothing is impossible_

> _You should get to the point  
Where anyone else would quit  
And you're not going to stop there  
No, what are you waiting for?_

> _Do it  
Just do it  
Yes you can  
Just do it  
If you're tired of starting over  
Stop giving up_
